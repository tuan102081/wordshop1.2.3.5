Problem:
    Explain the differences between the data types int and float.

Solution:
    -The data types int and long are among the two integer data types described in Java.
    -In Java, the types int and long are signed, +ve and -ve values. Java does not support unsigned int and long types.
    The fundamental difference between an int and long data type is the width of each type. The datatype int has the
    width of 32-bit for the variable of int type.
    -On the other hand, the data type long has the width of 64-bit for the variable of long type. The comparison chart
    below shows some other differences between int and long.
