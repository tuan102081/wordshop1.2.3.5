Problem:
    What is a mutator method? Explain why mutator methods usually return the
value None
Solution:
    Mutator method usually returns no value of interest to the caller.” In python the Nonevalue is returned. ...
This method does not have a return value. This is because “a change of state” is what is needed. However, in python it
automatically returns “None.
