Problem:
    Does the Boolean expression count > 0 and total // count > 0 contain a potential error? If not, why not?

Solution:
    Count >0 This statement is right if we match this with the syntax of regular comparison operation. Here count is an
    operand, “0” is the constant operand and these two operands are operated by the operator “>”. when we take total /
    count >0 Here count>0 returns Boolean and total is assumed to be an integer and an integer cannot be divided by a
    Boolean value. so it can be rectified as (total / count)>0.
