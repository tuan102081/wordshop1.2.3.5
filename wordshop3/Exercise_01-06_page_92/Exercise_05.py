Problem:
    What is the maximum number of guesses necessary to guess correctly a given number between the numbers N and M?

Solution:
    The problem is basically a Binary Search problem where you need to find a number between a given range of numbers.
    Given an interval [a,b], your guess should be the middle element i.e. (a+b)/2 at each step. If your guess is right,
    then great! Otherwise, you should adjust...
