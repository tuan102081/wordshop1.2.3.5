    The factorial of an integer N is the product of the integers between 1 and N, inclusive.
    Write a while loop that computes the factorial of a given integer N.

Solution:
    Display:
        Factorial of 4 = 24
"""
gt = 1
N = 4
count = N
while 0 < count <= count:
    gt *= count
    count -= 1
print("Factorial of", N, "=", gt)
