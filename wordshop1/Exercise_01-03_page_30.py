Problem:
    1.Suppose your script attempts to print the value of a variable that has not yet been
    assigned a value. How does the Python interpreter react?
    2.Miranda has forgotten to complete an arithmetic expression before the end of a line
    of code. How will the Python interpreter react?
    3.Why does Python code generate fewer types of syntax errors than code in other
    programming languages?


Solution:
    1.The interpreter will give a NameError error.
    2.It will give an error since an arithmetic equation cannot be in more than one line unless the
    line is ended with a \.
    3.We don't need to declare a data type for a variable. The compiler automatically sets the data types.
    Also there is auto conversions among different data types. Hence, it shows less errors due to this.
