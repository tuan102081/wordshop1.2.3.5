Problem:
    Open an IDLE window, and enter the program from Figure 1-7 that computes
    the area of a rectangle. Load the program into the shell by pressing the F5 key,
    and correct any errors that occur. Test the program with different inputs by
    running it at least three times.
Solution:

"""
width = int(input("Enter with width = "))
height = int(input("Enter with height = "))
area = width * height
print("This is area", area, "square units.")
