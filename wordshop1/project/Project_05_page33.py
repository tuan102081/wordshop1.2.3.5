Problem:
        Modify the program of Project 4 to compute the area of a triangle. Issue the
        appropriate prompts for the triangleâ€™s base and height, and change the names of
        the variables appropriately. Then, use the formula .5 * base * height to compute the area.
        Test the program from an IDLE window.

Solution:

"""
base = int(input("Enter with base = "))
height = int(input("Enter with height = "))
area = 5 * base * height
print("This is area", area, "triangle units.")
