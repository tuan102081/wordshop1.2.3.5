Problem:
    Evaluate the following code at a shell prompt: print ("Your name is", name).
Then assign name an appropriate value, and evaluate the statement again.
Solution:
        When no value has been assigned to "name"
        -> Display: " Traceback (most recent call last):
                        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
                        NameError: name 'name' is not defined "

        After having assigned the name an appropriate value
        >>> name = "Phan Thá»‹ Anh"
        -> Display: "  Your name is Nguyen Duy Tuan  "
