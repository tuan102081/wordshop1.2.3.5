Problem:
    1. List three common types of computing agents.
    2. Write an algorithm that describes the second part of the process of making change
    (counting out the coins and bills).
    3. Write an algorithm that describes a common task, such as baking a cake or operatstxing a DVD player.
    4. Describe an instruction that is not well defined and thus could not be included as a
    step in an algorithm. Give an example of such an instruction.
    5. In what sense is a laptop computer a general-purpose problem-solving machine?
    6. List four devices that use computers and describe the information that they process.

Solution:
    1.CPU, memory, input and output devices.
    4.an instruction that is not well defined is one that can not be performed effectively or cannot be executed
    by a computing agent. An example would be a step that says to divide a number by 0.
    5.It automates the tasks of solving problems that are solved by algorithms.
    6.Two input devices are a keyboard and microphone, they convert information such as text, images, and sound into
    information for computational processing. two output devices are monitors and speakers which convert the results
    of computational processing back to human-usable form.
